\begin{enumerate}

    \item Matter is made up of tiny particles called molecules. We can not see molecules with naked eyes.
    In solids, molecules are closely packed. They are not free to move. Solids have definite shape and volume.
    The molecules in gases are loosely packed. They can move freely. Gases have no definite shape and volume.

    \item Water has three forms - water, ice, steam. When we freeze water it changes to ice. On heating, ice changes to water.
    When we heat water it changes to steam. On cooling, steam changes to water.

    \item Leaves are green due to the presence of chlo-ro-phyll. Lower surface of leaves has tiny pores.
    Plants take carbon-di-oxide(C-20) and gives out oxygen. Plants can make their own food. The process by which plants make food is
    called photo-syn-thesis. Plants make food with the help of water, sunligth and carbon-di-oxide(C-20). Plants store food in the form of
    glucose.
