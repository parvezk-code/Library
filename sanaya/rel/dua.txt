Allahhum-magfirli warhamne wahdinee wa'afinee war-zuqnee

    O Allah forgive me, have mercy on me,  guide me, grant me well-being and provide for me.



Astaghfirullahal 'Azim Alladhi La Ilaha illa Huwal Hayyul Qayyumu wa atubu ilayhi
    I seek the forgiveness of Allah, there is no true god except Allah, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, and I turn to Him in repentance


Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiâ€™un. Allahumma-jurni fi musibati, wa akhlif li khairan minha
    Indeed we belong to allah and indeed to him we return, O allah grant me for my calamity and replace it for me that which is better
