Allahhum-magfirli warhamne wahdinee wa'afinee war-zuqnee

    O Allah forgive me, have mercy on me,  guide me, grant me well-being and provide for me.



Astaghfirullahal 'Azim Alladhi La Ilaha illa Huwal Hayyul Qayyumu wa atubu ilayhi
    I seek the forgiveness of Allah, there is no true god except Allah, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, and I turn to Him in repentance


Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiâ€™un. Allahumma-jurni fi musibati, wa akhlif li khairan minha
    Indeed we belong to allah and indeed to him we return, O allah grant me for my calamity and replace it for me that which is better


Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min 'adhabil-qabri, wa a'udhu bika min 'adhabin-nari, wa a'udhu bika min fitnatil-mahya wal-mamat wa a'udhu bika min sharril-masihid-dajjali
    O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the torment of the grave, and I seek refuge with You from the torment of the Fire, and I seek refuge with You from the trials of life and death, and I seek refuge with You from the evil of the Al-Masihid-Dajjal.

Allahumma inni a'udhu bika minal-hammi, wal-hazani, wal-'ajzi, wal-kasali, wal-bukhli, wal-jubni, wa ghalabatar-rijal
    O Allah, I seek refuge with You from worry, grief, incapacity, laziness, miserliness, cowardice and being overpowered by (other) men"


This is not in quran and hadith, Allahumma Ajirni Minnaar : O Allah, protect me from Hell
