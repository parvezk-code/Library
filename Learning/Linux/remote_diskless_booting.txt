-------------------- PXE Booting ------------------------------------------------------

Server configuration:

    # DHCP server : assign IP addresses to our diskless nodes.
    # TFTP server : transfer the boot image (a requirement of all PXE option roms).
    # A form of network storage (NFS or NBD) to export the Arch installation to the diskless node.
    # TFTP server will be used to transfer the bootloader, kernel, and initramfs to the client.
    # create a full Linux installation in a subdirectory on the server.

How it works (simplified scheme):

    # The computer bios/uefi sends ordinary dhcp request (DHCPDISCOVER)
    # The dhcp server sends a response with the next-server option
    # The computer sends DHCPREQUEST/DHCPINFORM request
    # The dhcp server sends TFTP server address and the filename to upload
    # The computer downloads this file from the tftp server. Its size is limited so, often, it's a bootloader like pxeinux
    # pxelinux reads its own config and downloads Linux kernel using initramfs
    # Linux kernel downloads squashfs with main rootfs
    # switch_root to its squashfs
