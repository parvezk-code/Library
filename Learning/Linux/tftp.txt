    # make linux portable : install linux in pen-drive.

    # avoid reinstallation:
        --> install linux once in pen-drive.
        --> use gnome disks utility to create image of the pen-drive.
        --> copy these images into another pen-drive

    # avoid software installation
        --> use dockers
        --> use appimage software if possible
