\begin{enumerate}
    \item   Solve assuming a condition(value) and check with options matches the result.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item When ever there is formula needs to be drived in terms of say i, j, k. Always assume values say i=2, j=3, k=5 and check which option matches the value. Example GATE-94 array question.
            \item if a tree is under consideration. Assume a tree with only root node or 2 nodes or 3 nodes and solve.
            \item If stack or queue is in picture assume appropriate values in stack and queue and solve.
