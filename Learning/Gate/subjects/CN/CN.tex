  \question  In serial data transmission, every byte of data is padded with a '0' in the beginning and
             one or two '1' s at the end of byte because  (GATE-2002)

  \begin{choices}
    \CorrectChoice  Receiver is to be synchronized for byte reception
    \choice         Receiver recovers lost ‘0’ and ‘1’s from these padded bits
    \choice         Padded bits are useful in parity computation
    \choice         None of these
