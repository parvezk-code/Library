  \question  A CPU has 24-bit instructions. A program starts at address 300 (in decimal). Which one
             of the following is a legal program counter (all values in decimal)?  (GATE-2006)

  \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice         400
    \choice         500

  \question  Consider two processors P1 and P2 executing the same instruction set. Assume that under
             identical conditions, for the same input, a program running on P2 takes 25\% less time but
             incurs 20\% more CPI (clock cycles per instruction) as compared to the program
             running on P1. If the clock frequency of P1 is 1GHz, then the clock frequency of
             P2 (in GHz) is \fillin[1.6]  (GATE-2014\_Set\_1)
             \\ Time = T \quad No of Instructions = I \quad Cycles per instruction = CPI \quad Cycle Time = CT = 1/F
             \\ T = I x CPI x CT  \qquad  T = { \Large \( \frac{I * CPI}{F}  \) }

  \question  Consider a processor with byte-addressable memory. Assume that all registers,
             including Program Counter (PC) and Program Status Word (PSW), are of size 2 bytes. A
             stack in the main memory is implemented from memory location (0100)16 and it grows
             upward. The stack pointer (SP) points to the top element of the stack. The current
             value of SP is (016E)16. The CALL instruction is of two words, the first word is
             the op-code and the second word is the starting address of the subroutine
             (one word = 2 bytes). The CALL instruction is implemented as follows: (GATE-2015\_Set\_2)
             \\ \(\rightarrow\) Store the current value of PC in the stack.
             \\ \(\rightarrow\) Store the value of PSW register in the stack.
             \\ \(\rightarrow\) Load the starting address of the subroutine in PC. \\
             The content of PC just before the fetch of a CALL instruction is (5FA0)16. After
             execution of the CALL instruction, the value of the stack pointer is

  \begin{oneparchoices}
    \choice         016A
    \choice         016C
    \choice         0170
    \CorrectChoice  0172
  \end{oneparchoices}
  \\ Hint : Call instruction will push contents of PC(2 Bytes) and PSW(2 Bytes) to the stack.
  \\ Hint : Memory is byte addressable. This will increase stack top by 4.
