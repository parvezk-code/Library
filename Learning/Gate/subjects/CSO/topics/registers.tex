\begin{questyle}
  \question  Consider the expression (a-1) * ((( b + c ) / 3 )) + d)). Let X be the minimum number of
             registers required by an optimal code generation (without any register spill) algorithm
             for a load/store architecture, in which  (GATE-2017\_Set\_1)
             \\ 1). only load and store instructions can have memory operands and
             \\ 2). arithmetic instructions can have only register or immediate operands.
             \\ The value of X is \fillin[2]
