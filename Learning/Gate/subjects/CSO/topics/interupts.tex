  \begin{choices}
    \choice         Neither vectored interrupt nor multiple interrupting devices are possible.
    \choice         Vectored interrupts are not possible but multiple interrupting devices are possible.
    \CorrectChoice  Vectored interrupts and multiple interrupting devices are both possible.
