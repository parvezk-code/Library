  \question  A function f defined on stacks of integers satisfies the following properties. \\
             f(\(\phi\)) = 0  \\
             f(push (S, i)) = max (f(S), 0) + i for all stacks S and integers i. \\
             If a stack S contains the integers 2, -3, 2, -1, 2 in order from bottom to top, what is f(S)?  (GATE-2005)\\
             Hint : f(S) is evaluated at every push(S, i) operation.\\

  \question  A priority queue Q is used to implement a stack S that stores characters. PUSH(C) is implemented as
             INSERT(Q, C, K) where K is an appropriate integer key chosen by the implementation. POP is implemented as
             DELETEMIN(Q). For a sequence of operations, the keys chosen are in.  (GATE-1997)
