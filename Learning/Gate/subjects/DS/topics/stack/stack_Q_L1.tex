  \question  Consider the following statements:  (GATE-1996)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item First-in-first out types of computations are efficiently supported by STACKS.
        \item Implementing LISTS on linked lists is more efficient than implementing LISTS on an array for almost all the basic LIST operations.
        \item Implementing QUEUES on a circular array is more efficient than implementing QUEUES on a linear array with two indices.
        \item Last-in-first-out type of computations are efficiently supported by QUEUES.
    \end{enumerate}
