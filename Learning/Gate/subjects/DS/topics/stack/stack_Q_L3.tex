\begin{questyle}
  \question  Let S be a stack of size \(n >= 1\) . Starting with the empty stack, suppose we push the first n natural
            numbers in sequence, and then perform n pop operations. Assume that Push and pop operation take X seconds
            each, and Y seconds elapse between the end of one such stack operation and the start of the next operation.
            For \( m >= 1 \), define the stack-life of m as the time elapsed from the end of Push(m) to the start of the pop
            operation that removes m from S. The average stack-life of an element of this stack is  (GATE-2003) \\
            Hint : solve for n=1 and choose which option is correct.

  \begin{choices}
    \choice         n(X + Y)
    \choice         3Y + 2X
    \CorrectChoice  n(X + Y) - X
    \choice         Y + 2X
