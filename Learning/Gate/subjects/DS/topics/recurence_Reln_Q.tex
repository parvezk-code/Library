\centerline{\textbf{ \LARGE Recurence Relations}}

\begin{questyle}
  \question  The recurrence relation capturing the optimal execution time of the Towers of Hanoi problem with n discs is  (GATE-2012)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item First-in-first out types of computations are efficiently supported by STACKS.
        \item Implementing LISTS on linked lists is more efficient than implementing LISTS on an array for almost all the basic LIST operations.
        \item Implementing QUEUES on a circular array is more efficient than implementing QUEUES on a linear array with two indices.
        \item Last-in-first-out type of computations are efficiently supported by QUEUES.
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{choices}
    \choice         T(n) = 2T(n-2) + 2
    \choice         T(n) = 2T(n-1) + n
    \choice         T(n) = 2T(n/2) + 1
    \CorrectChoice  T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1
  \end{choices}
