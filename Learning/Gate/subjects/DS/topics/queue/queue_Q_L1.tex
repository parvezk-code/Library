\begin{questyle}
  \question  A Circular queue has been implemented using singly linked list where each node consists of a value and
             a pointer to next node. We maintain exactly two pointers FRONT and REAR pointing to the front node and
             rear node of queue. Which of the following statements is/are correct for circular queue so that insertion
             and deletion operations can be performed in O(1) i.e. constant time. (GATE-2017) \\
             I). Next pointer of front node points to the rear node. \\
             II).Next pointer of rear node points to the front node.

  \begin{choices}
    \choice         I only
    \CorrectChoice  II only
    \choice         Both I and II
    \choice         Neither I nor II
  \end{choices}
