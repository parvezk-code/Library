\begin{questyle}
  \question  Suppose a circular queue of capacity (n â€“ 1) elements is implemented with an array of n elements.
            Assume that the insertion and deletion operation are carried out using REAR and FRONT as array index variables, respectively. Initially, REAR = FRONT = 0. The conditions to detect queue full and queue empty are  (GATE-2012)

  \begin{choices}
    \CorrectChoice  Full: (REAR+1) mod n == FRONT, empty: REAR == FRONT
    \choice         Full: (REAR+1) mod n == FRONT, empty: (FRONT+1) mod n == REAR
    \choice         Full: REAR == FRONT, empty: (REAR+1) mod n == FRONT
    \choice         Full: (FRONT+1) mod n == REAR, empty: REAR == FRONT
  \end{choices}
