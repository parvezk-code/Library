  \question  Which of the following sequences of array elements forms a heap?  (GATE-2006)

\begin{questyle}
  \question  An array X of n distinct integers is interpreted as a complete binary tree. The index
            of the first element of the array is 0. If only the root node does not satisfy the heap
            property, the algorithm to convert the complete binary tree into a heap has the best
            asymptotic time complexity of  (GATE-2006)

  \begin{choices}
    \choice         O(n)
    \CorrectChoice  O(log n)
    \choice         O(nlog n)
    \choice         O(nlog(logn))
  \end{choices}
