\begin{questyle}
  \question  In the balanced binary tree in the below figure, how many nodes will become unbalanced when a
             node is inserted as a child of the node “g”?  (GATE-1996)

        \begin{myTree}
        \node [circle,draw] [blue] (node_a){a}
            child
            {
                node [circle,draw] (node_b) {b}
                child
                {
                    node [circle,draw] (node_c) {c}
                    child { node [circle,draw] (node_g) {g} }
                }
                child
                {
                    node [circle,draw] (node_d) {d}
                }
