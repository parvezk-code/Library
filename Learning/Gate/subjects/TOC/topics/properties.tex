    \item Every subset of a regular set is regular. [F]
    \item Every finite set is regular. [T]
    \item Union of two non regular sets is not regular. [F]
    \item Infinite union of finite sets is regular. [F]
    \item Let there be 2 languages L1, L2, such that L1 = {\large \( \phi \)}. Then L1.L2 = {\large \(\phi\) } [T]
    \item Regular language is closed under - Union, Intersection, Kleene Closure, Concatenation, Complementation, Difference, Reversal
    \item Context free languages are closed under - Union, Concatenation and Kleene closure
    \item Context free languages are not closed under - Intersection and Complement.
    \item Properties for intersection and difference are same.
