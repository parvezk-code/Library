\centerline{\textbf{ \LARGE  Properties Regular Languages }}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every subset of a regular set is regular. [F]
    \item Every finite set is regular. [T]
    \item Union of two non regular sets is not regular. [F]
    \item Infinite union of finite sets is regular. [F]
    \item Let there be 2 languages L1, L2, such that L1 = {\large \( \phi \)}. Then L1.L2 = {\large \(\phi\) } [T]
    \item Regular language is closed under - Union, Intersection, Kleene Closure, Concatenation, Complementation, Difference, Reversal

\end{enumerate}
