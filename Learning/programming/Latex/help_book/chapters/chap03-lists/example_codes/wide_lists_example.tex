% Wide lists: labels align with paragraph, subsequent lines unindented
\noindent Wide list for paragraph-like items:
\par
\begin{itemize}[wide,nosep]
  \item This item demonstrates wide layout so that wrapped lines align with the text block instead of being indented.
  \item Another wide item to illustrate multi-line behavior with compact spacing.
\end{itemize}
